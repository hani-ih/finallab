            <h1>Its'time to #PRESSRESET</h1>
            <p>Have you ever felt lost with skincare?<br><br>
                There is so much information to digest and so much to apply - literally. 
                You’re constantly being told to buy this new miracle cream or to try that new all-in-one mask. 
                You've been told your skin needs all these A to Z in skincare. You just don’t know what to do, 
                or where to even start.<br><br>
                We feel you.<br><br>
                We empower people to believe in the skin they have, not the skin the beauty industry tells them
                to have. We’re for people who want skincare without the confusion.

            <h1>Hi, we're krave Beauty</h1>
            <p>We’re a skincare company that sells a cleanser while telling you to cleanse less. Our mission is 
                to challenge the fast-paced beauty industry to slow down and help people to #PressReset on the way 
                they look at skincare.<br><br>
                A bit more about us? We’re a brand created by beauty influencer Liah Yoo and a team of people who’s 
                “been there, done that”. Everyone in the team had their moment of wanting to pull their hair out because 
                skincare became so complicated—until they pressed reset.<br><br>
                We dream big. We’re here to #PressReset on the conventions of skincare, and help people get in tune with their 
                skin’s cravings. When the industry zigs, we zag. When others tell everyone to apply more, we’re here to shout that
                our skin is smart.</p>
